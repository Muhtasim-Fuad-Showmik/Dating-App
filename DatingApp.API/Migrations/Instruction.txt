Created this folder and files by running the following line in the terminal:
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

>The file "DataContextModelSnapshot.cs" keeps track of all the migrations,
so that it does not have to ask the database each time to find this information.

>The file "20200903071328_InitialCreate.Designer.cs" keeps track of what to remove
from "DataContextModelSnapshot.cs". Another file for keeping track of migrations.

>The file "20200903071328_InitialCreate.cs" has two functions, "up" and "down".
The up function can create tables based on our Values class in the model.
The down function drops the table from our database.

To update a database or create one if none has been created already, run:
dotnet ef database update.

After database has been updated, you can us the "Db Broswer for Sqlite" to add new records
into the table under the "Browse Data" tab. You can edit each field using the Text Editor
on the right and apply your changes. Finally to write all your changes into the actual
database, click on "Write Changes".
